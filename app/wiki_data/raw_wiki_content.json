  "Helsingfors": "Helsingborg (, US also , Swedish: [h\u025bls\u026a\u014b\u02c8b\u0254rj] ), is a city and the seat of Helsingborg Municipality, Scania (Sk\u00e5ne), Sweden. It is the second-largest city in Scania (after Malm\u00f6) and ninth-largest in Sweden, with a population of 151,404 (2024). Helsingborg is the central urban area of northwestern Scania and Sweden's closest point to Denmark: the Danish city Helsing\u00f8r is clearly visible about 4 km (2.5 mi) to the west on the other side of the \u00d8resund. \nHistoric Helsingborg, with its many old buildings, is a scenic coastal city. The buildings are a blend of old-style stone-built churches and a 600-year-old medieval fortress (K\u00e4rnan) in the city centre, and more modern commercial buildings. The streets vary from wide avenues to small alley-ways. Kullagatan, the main pedestrian shopping street in the city, was the first pedestrian shopping street in Sweden.\n\n\n== History ==\nHelsingborg is one of the oldest cities of what is now Sweden. It has been the site of permanent settlement officially since 21 May 1085. Helsingborg's geographical position at the narrowest part of \u00d8resund made it very important for Denmark, at that time controlling both sides of that strait. From 1429 Eric of Pomerania introduced the Sound Dues, a levy on all trading vessels passing through the sound between Helsing\u00f8r and Helsingborg. This was one of the main sources of income for the Danish Crown. Crossing traffic, like fishermen, were not subject to the tax, which was initially directed against the Hanseatic League.Following the Dano-Swedish War (1657\u20131658) and the Treaty of Roskilde Denmark had to give up all territory on the southern Scandinavian peninsula, and Helsingborg became part of Sweden. King Charles X Gustav of Sweden landed here on 5 March 1658 to take personal possession of the Scanian lands and was met by a delegation led by the bishop of the Diocese of Lund, Peder Winstrup. At that time the town had a population of barely 1,000 people.\nIts situation on a conflict-ridden border caused problems for Helsingborg. Denmark recaptured Scania twice, but could not hold it. The last Danish attempt to regain Scania was in 1710, when 14,000 men landed on the shores near Helsingborg. The Battle of Helsingborg was fought on 10 March just outside the city, which was badly affected. It took a long time to recover; even in 1770 the city had only 1,321 inhabitants and was still growing slowly.\nOn 20 October 1811, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, Marshal of France and crown prince-elect of Sweden (later King Charles XIV John) took his first step on Swedish soil in Helsingborg on his journey from Paris to Stockholm.\nFrom the middle of the 19th century onwards, Helsingborg was one of the fastest-growing cities of Sweden, increasing its population from 4,000 in 1850 to 20,000 in 1890 and 56,000 in 1930 due to industrialization. From 1892, a train ferry was put in service, connecting Helsingborg with its Danish sister city Helsing\u00f8r. A tramway network was inaugurated in 1903 and closed down in 1967.\nFollowing the Swedish orthography reform of 1906, the spelling of many place names in Sweden was modernized. In 1912, it was decided to use the form H\u00e4lsingborg. In preparation for the local government reform in 1971, H\u00e4lsingborg city council proposed that the new, enlarged municipality should be spelled Helsingborg; this form was adopted by the government of Sweden from 1 January 1971.\nIn World War II, Helsingborg was among the most important drop-off points for the rescue of Denmark's Jewish population during the Holocaust. Adolf Hitler had ordered that all Danish Jews were to be arrested and deported to the concentration camps on Rosh HaShanah, the Jewish New Year which fell on 2 October 1943. When Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz, a German maritime attach\u00e9 received word of the order on 28 September 1943, he shared it with political and Jewish community leaders. Using the name Elsinore Sewing Club (Danish: Helsing\u00f8r Syklub) as a cover for messages, the Danish population formed an Underground Railroad of sorts, moving Jews away from the closely watched Copenhagen docks to spots farther away, especially Helsing\u00f8r, just two miles across the \u00d8resund from Helsingborg. Hundreds of civilians hid their fellow Danish citizens\u2014Jews\u2014in their houses, farm lofts and churches until they could board them onto Danish fishing boats, personal pleasure boats and ferry boats. In the span of three nights, Danes had smuggled over 7200 Jews and 680 non-Jews (gentile family members of Jews or political activists) across the \u00d8resund, to safety in Sweden, with one of the main destinations at Helsingborg.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nHelsingborg has an oceanic climate (Cfb) typical of southern Sweden, although its winters are very mild for a location at such a high latitude. Although the temperature differences between seasons are significant, Helsingborg often lacks a meteorological winter with both January and February averaging just above the freezing point in terms of mean temperatures. Summers are warm and comparatively long by Swedish standards, with summer arriving earlier and fall later than virtually all areas of Sweden, aside from other parts of Sk\u00e5ne. Helsingborg & nearby surroundings also have a history with being hit by tornadoes. On 8 August 1947, a High-end F1/T3 Tornado hit the Raml\u00f6sa district of Helsingborg, causing moderate damage to a farm. Greenhouses were damaged or destroyed, a stall sustained deroofing, a shed was blown away and a tree was snapped. On 16 August 2007, downtown Helsingborg was impacted by an F1 Tornado, damaging a school and snapping trees. On 22 June 2014, a Waterspout was observed outside Helsingborg. On 27 August 2018, the Eskilsminne district of Helsingborg was hit by an F0 Tornado. Some roofs sustained minor damage.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n113,816 live in the city of Helsingborg as of 2020, up from 104,250 inhabitants in 2015. 149,280 live in the municipality, with the city being by far the most populated one. Helsingborg is the second-largest city in Scania (after Malm\u00f6) and ninth-largest in Sweden.\n\n\n== Subdivisions ==\nThe City of Helsingborg is subdivided into 31 districts. \n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Industry ===\nHelsingborg is a major regional centre of trade, transport and business. In 2001 Campus Helsingborg, a branch of University of Lund, opened in the former Tretorn rubber factory buildings, founded by Henry Dunker.\nThree ferry companies take people and cargo to and from Denmark around the clock. The route is popular with day-trippers going to Helsing\u00f8r or Copenhagen, or simply enjoying the views from the ferries.\nIKEA, the retailer of furniture and home interiors, has its international corporate headquarters in Helsingborg.\nNicorette, the nicotine chewing gum, has a manufacturing plant there. Raml\u00f6sa is a mineral water from Raml\u00f6sa Brunn, a southern suburb of the city. Mobile phone developer Spectronic is also situated in Helsingborg. The online custom clothing retailer Tailor Store Sweden AB has its offices in Helsingborg. Zo\u00e9gas, a major coffee company, has been located here since the 1800s.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nThe beverage espresso and tonic first appeared on a menu in the city, at the coffeehouse Koppi Roasters in 2007.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe following sports clubs are located in Helsingborg:\n\nThe Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) and World Bowling Tour (WBT) have jointly hosted a ten-pin bowling event in Sweden since 2017 called the Lucky Larsen Masters. Olympia Bowling in Helsingborg hosted the event in 2019, and is scheduled to host again in September 2023.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPort of Helsingborg\nEuropean route E4\nHelsingborgs Dagblad\nSofiero Palace, a nearby castle\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Helsingborg at Wikimedia Commons\n Helsingborg travel guide from Wikivoyage\n Helsingborg travel guide from Wikivoyage\nHelsingborg Municipality",
  "\u00c5bo": "Turku ( TOOR-koo; Finnish: [\u02c8turku] ; Swedish: \u00c5bo, Finland Swedish: [\u02c8o\u02d0bu] ) is a city in Finland and the regional capital of Southwest Finland. It is located on the southwestern coast of the country at the mouth of the River Aura. The population of Turku is approximately 206,000, while the metropolitan area has a population of approximately 316,000. It is the 6th most populous municipality in Finland, and the third most populous urban area in the country after Helsinki and Tampere.\nTurku is Finland's oldest city. It is not known when Turku was granted city status. Pope Gregory IX first mentioned the town of Aboa in his Bulla in 1229, and this year is now used as the founding year of the city. Turku was the most important city in the eastern part of the Kingdom of Sweden (today's Finland). After the Finnish War, Finland became an autonomous Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire in 1809, and Turku became the capital of the Grand Duchy. However, Turku lost its status as capital only three years later in 1812, when Tsar Alexander I of Russia decided to move the capital to Helsinki. It was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most government institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Royal Academy of Turku, founded in 1640, which later became the University of Helsinki, thus consolidating Helsinki's position as the new capital. Turku was Finland's most populous city until the late 1840s and remains the regional capital, an important business and cultural centre, and a port.\nDue to its long history, Turku has been the site of many important events and, as a former capital, has had a major influence on Finnish history. Together with Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, Turku was named European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, the city of Turku was declared the \"Christmas City\" of Finland. Turku has also been officially declared the Food Capital of Finland, as it is home to some of Finland's oldest and highest quality restaurants, as well as a historically famous fish market held twice a year. Turku's canteen and caf\u00e9 culture has often been compared to French food culture, which is why Turku is also known as the \"Paris of Finland\", hence the Swedish saying: \"Varf\u00f6r Paris, vi har ju \u00c5bo!\" (\"Why Paris, we have Turku!\").\nTurku is a bilingual municipality with Finnish and Swedish as its official languages. The population consists of 78% Finnish speakers, 5% Swedish speakers, and 17% speakers of other languages, which is well above the national average.\nDue to its location, the Port of Turku is an important commercial and passenger seaport, with over three million passengers travelling to Stockholm and Mariehamn each year.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, which in modern Russian means market place, haggling or trading. The word was also borrowed into Swedish as torg, \"market\", but it likely entered Finnish directly, rather than via Swedish. Over time, the original meaning faded, and by the Middle Ages, turku had become synonymous with the town's name. Today the word is rarely used outside idiomatic expressions.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).\nIn Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nSettlement in the Turku area is relatively recent, as the Southwestern Finland remained below sea level for an extended period due to the Ice Age. Due to tectonic uplift, the Turku region transformed from an outlying archipelago to a shoreline during 3000-2000 BCE. The area was densely populated during the Iron Age as it was the most important agricultural region in the region. Ancient cemeteries dating from 550 to 1150 have been discovered in the region. Some cemeteries were utilized during the initial migratory phase, while some were solely utilized during the Viking Age, and others were established in the 12th century. There are also remains of houses and villages and old forts from the late Iron Age.\nAccording to legend, the English bishop Henry baptised the first Finns into Christianity in 1150. However, the first Christian graves date from the 10th and 11th centuries, and the first archaeological evidence of a church dates from the 12th century. In the 11th century, the Turku region began to develop as a port. The oldest known road, H\u00e4meen h\u00e4rk\u00e4tie, connected to region and the Old Castle of Lieto to Tavastia in the 9th century at the latest. Early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku.\n\n\n=== Swedish era ===\n\nAccording to the permission granted by Pope Gregory IX on 23 January 1229, the episcopal seat was moved from Nousiainen to Koroinen, which is located near the current center of Turku. There is nothing to suggest that the actual city of Turku still existed at this point; however, the city was not founded on uninhabited land, but there were fields and probably also a peasant village. Since no reliable document has survived about the year of the city's founding, it has also been speculated that the city was founded in the 1280s or 1290s by the joint initiative of the king, the bishop, and the Dominican Convent of Saint Olaf, which itself was founded in 1249.\nTurku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300. During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, it was for a long time the most important city in Finland as part of the trade and shipping of the Hanseatic League. In the 14th century, two-thirds of the city's burghers were German, but gradually the proportion of domestic burghers increased. In addition to the ecclesiastical authority, the only lawspeakers in Finland operated in Turku, and from the 15th century to the 16th century, the court exercising the country's highest judicial power, the Land Court of Turku, met in the city.\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, in connection with the disputes of the Kalmar Union, the Danes destroyed the city twice, in 1509 under the leadership of Admiral Otte Rud and in 1522 under the leadership of Admiral S\u00f8ren Norby, until Erik Fleming's troops expelled the Danes from Finland in 1523. After the beginning of peace, Gustav Vasa, who had just become king, thoroughly got to know different parts of his kingdom, the center of the king's first visit to Finland being Turku Castle, where he lived during his visit. The new king also brought with him the religious reformation, and the first to preach the new doctrine was Petrus S\u00e4rkilahti. S\u00e4rkilahti's student Mikael Agricola, who is known as the \"father of Finnish literary language\", continued the religious reform first as the headmaster of the cathedral school and later as the Bishop of Turku. Duke John (later John III), the son of Gustav Vasa, received the title of Duke of Finland and ruled his territory from Turku Castle before becoming next king of Sweden after his brother, Eric XIV.\nIn the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the city was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. After that, the 17th century began as more peaceful period for Turku, when the focus was mainly on emphasizing Turku's position as the center of a wide area by establishing numerous new administrative and school institutions. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku by order of Queen Christina. This project was also supported by Count Per Brahe, the Governor General of Finland, and Isaacus Rothovius, the Bishop of Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\n\n=== Russian era ===\n\nAfter the Finnish War, Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809. There was no resistance of any kind in Turku when the Russians marched into the city in October 1809 in connection with the Finnish War. Despite the occupation, life in Turku continued peacefully. The Court of Appeal of Turku continued its session when the Russians arrived, and later in the spring Jacob Tengstr\u00f6m, the Archbishop of Turku and Finland, and the teaching staff of the Turku Academy swore an oath of loyalty to their new ruler.\nTurku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. The new city plan, based on a regular grid plan, was more spacious and fire-safe than before, and after the reconstruction, Turku was one of the most unified architecture in Europe. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\nIn the middle of the 19th century, Turku was, after Helsinki, the most important craft city in Finland, but the Industrial Revolution with steam and electric machines was experienced in Turku only around 1900. The First World War provided a boost to the city's industry, as the export difficulties affected the wood industry, which Turku didn't have much of, and it was easy to get much-needed raw materials from neutral Sweden.\n\n\n=== After independence ===\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish-language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish-language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.\n\nAs for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject of the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSituated at the mouth of the Aura River in the south-western corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) on both banks of the river. The eastern side, where Turku Cathedral is located, is the older and original centre. It is popularly known as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"). The western side, where Turku Castle is located, is the newer part. It is called tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). In modern times, both banks of the Aura River are equally the centre of the city.\nThere are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards. These do not operate as units of local government. However, some social programmes are district-based, especially in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in some areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, Kakskerta and Paattinen are the largest districts.\nAs many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is around 6.0 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport. The weather in the city itself is affected by the proximity of the sea, so the wintertime temperatures are often milder than those measured at the airport. The moderating impact of the sea helps oak maple and ash trees, which are quite rare elsewhere in Finland, to thrive by the areas along the shoreline and in the archipelago.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nThe city of Turku has 206,035 inhabitants, making it the 6th most populous municipality in Finland. The Turku metropolitan area has a population of 315,509, and the larger Turku sub-region has a population of 351,414. This is making it the third largest region in Finland after Helsinki and Tampere. Turku is home to 4% of Finland's population. 17 per cent of the population has a foreign background, which is almost twice as high as the national average. However, it is lower than in the major Finnish cities of Helsinki, Espoo or Vantaa.\nThe city's population density is 794.4 inhabitants per square kilometre. The median age in the city is 42.1, lower than the national average of 43.6.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThe city of Turku is officially bilingual, with both Finnish and Swedish as official languages. As of 2024, the majority of the population, 160,561 persons (77.9%), spoke Finnish as their first language. The number of Swedish speakers was 11,164 persons (5.4%) of the population. Foreign languages were spoken by 16.7% of the population. As English and Swedish are compulsory school subjects, functional bilingualism or trilingualism acquired through language studies is not uncommon.\nMore than a hundred different languages are spoken as mother tongues in Turku, and citizens from more than 130 countries live in the city. The people of Turku also represent all major religions. The most commonly spoken foreign languages are Russian (1.9%), Arabic (1.8%), Albanian (1.2%), Kurdish (1.2%), Ukrainian (0.9%) and Somali (0.9%).\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\n\nAs of 2024, there were 35,088 people with a foreign background living in Turku, or 17% of the population. There were 31,223 residents who were born abroad, or 15% of the population. The number of foreign citizens in Turku was 21,665.\nThe relative share of immigrants in Turku's population is well above the national average. Moreover, the city's new residents are increasingly of foreign origin. This will increase the proportion of foreign residents in the coming years.\nMost foreign-born citizens came from the former Soviet Union, Iraq, Estonia, Sweden, Iran, the former Yugoslavia, Ukraine and Somalia.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nIn 2023, the Evangelical Lutheran Church was the largest religious group with 56.3% of the population of Turku. Other religious groups accounted for 3.3% of the population. 40.4% of the population had no religious affiliation.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Turku region boasts 22,000 enterprises, two universities and four polytechnics. The city has also business branches with local expertise in the maritime, life sciences, information technology, entertainment, biotechnology, and sustainable development industries. The city's economic hub revolves around the Port of Turku and other service-oriented sectors. The dockyard of Meyer Turku and the maritime business cluster reign as the leading industrial employer in the area. The city also boasts a high-tech centre in the Turku Science Park area, with a growing role in the information technology and biotechnology industries in recent decades.\nThe Turku region hosts the business service centre Potkuri and the start-up community SparkUp. In addition, the West Finland Film Commission works to promote favourable operating conditions for companies in the AV industry and for the production of films and TV series in the Turku region. Turku Future Technologies is a development centre and research and innovation network supported by eight Finnish universities. Smart Chemistry Park is a collaborative platform and network for the bio- and circular economy as well as the chemical industry in Raisio. Meanwhile, Blue Industry Park is a growing cluster for maritime and manufacturing industries.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCultural venues in Turku include several museums, theatres, cinemas, art galleries, and music. Turku offers a variety of cultural events. The most important one is the declaration of Christmas Peace on 24 December in the Old Great Square. The tradition is about 700 years old. Other notable events include the Medieval Market, the Music Festival, the Book Fair, the Film Day, the Animated Film Festival TAFF, the Jazz Festival, the Paavo Nurmi Games of athletics, the Ruisrock rock festival, the Down by the Laituri music festival and the New Performance Turku Biennale.\nTurku was the European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\n\n\n=== Medieval buildings ===\n\nAccording to archaeological evidence, Turku started to get built in the late 13th Century. However, only a few of its medieval buildings have survived to the present day. The primary factor was the Great Fire in 1827, which decimated three quarters of the city. Turku Cathedral, constructed in the 13th century, is one of the oldest still-functioning buildings. It is also Finland's only medieval basilica church. Another surviving edifice from the medieval era is Turku Castle, which was established in the 1280s and underwent several expansions in the 15th century. Only the ruins remain of the bishop's church in Koroistenniemi, Koroinen, but the white cross serves as a reminder of the bishop's castle that existed centuries ago. Qwensel House, the oldest wooden house in Turku dating back to the 18th century, has been converted into a museum. No other medieval buildings have survived to the present day.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nMost of Turku's museums are situated beside the Aura River. The Turku Art Museum is housed in a granite castle, with exhibits of both classical and contemporary art. Turku Cathedral and its museum, located on the banks of the Aura River, provide information about the history and artifacts of the church. Adjacent to the cathedral, Ett Hem, a 19th-century bourgeois residence, and the Sibelius Museum, which displays a collection of musical instruments, can be found. Aboa Vetus & Ars Nova presents a fusion of medieval ruins and modern art. On Vartiovuori, lies the Luostarinm\u00e4ki Craftsman Museum, which represents a wooden housing locality dating back to the 18th century.\nThe Pharmacy Museum and Qwensel House hold the distinction of being Turku's earliest wooden abode, offering a glimpse into the bourgeois life of the 18th century and a 19th-century drugstore. The contemporary art museum, WAM, is named after Turku's sculptor, W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen. Additionally, the Biological Museum serves as a diorama museum covering Finnish wildlife and fauna. Forum Marinum is a maritime museum of exhibits and museum vessels, including the frigate Suomen Joutsen and the last commercial steam ship in Scandinavia MS Bore.

The Turku Philharmonic Orchestra is the oldest ensemble in Finland, tracing its origins to the establishment of the Turun Soitannollinen Seura in 1790. The orchestra has a reputation for its classical repertoire and frequently conducts concerts throughout Finland.\nTurku boasts a selection of music festivals, catering to diverse tastes and moods. The longest running rock festival in Finland, Ruisrock, is held on the island of Ruissalo. Aura Fest is a new city-based festival, set to debut in the summer of 2022. DBTL is another city festival, situated along the banks of the Aura River. Turku Jazz is an annual festival in July. August sees the Turku Music Festival, dedicated to classical music.\n\n\n=== Association and city rivalry ===\nThe Finnish people associate Turku with its \"old and historic\" charm. Established in 1957, Turkuseura-\u00c5bosamfundet ry is a bilingual, politically neutral historical society with 2,200 members. Its main focus is to cherish Turku's culture and dialect, and to preserve local history and traditions. The society strives to promote and enhance Turku's positive image.\nTurku and Tampere are two cities in Finland that exhibit a cordial rivalry through humorous banter. Humorous topics include Tampere's traditional dish, mustamakkara, Turku's Aura River, and distinct regional accents. Both cities boast excellent culinary scenes, which attract food lovers. Since 1997, students from Tampere have annually visited Turku to participate in the custom of leaping on the market square. This lively event is thought to nudge the city towards the Baltic Sea and counteract post-glacial rebound.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nTurku has two major football teams: FC Inter, playing in the top national league, Veikkausliiga, and TPS in Ykk\u00f6nen, one level below. Both teams are based at Veritas Stadion in Kupittaa.\nThe HC TPS is an ice hockey team that competes in the top level, SM-liiga, and has secured 11 national championships. They play their games at Gatorade Center in Artukainen.\nThe city also hosts the annual Paavo Nurmi Marathon, named after the legendary Turku-born runner Paavo Nurmi.\nTurku is home to the Eagles Rugby Football Club, a division champion affiliated with Suomen Rugbyliitto, which trains and competes at Impivaara Jalkapallonhalli and Kuppitaanpuisto.\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club with a rich history, having scored three silver and one gold medals in Finland's national lacrosse league.

The current chair of the city board is Sini Ruohonen from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2019 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party 20.5%\nSocial Democratic Party 17.1%\nLeft Alliance 16.8%\nTrue Finns 15.7%\nGreen League 13.8%\nSwedish People's Party 5.5%\nCentre Party 4.7%\nMovement Now 1.9%\nChristian Democrats 1.6%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region's Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.\nRail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century.  However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. According to the current estimate the tramway's construction will start in 2026 and finish in 2031. The first route will be constructed between Turku Port\u2212City Centre\u2212Varissuo residential area. Route's estimated length is 11 kilometers (6.8 miles) with 17 stops.\nThe first outdoor inclined elevator, the Funicular, is located in Turku. The elevator offers unimpeded access to Kakolanm\u00e4ki hill where is no other public transport. The Funicular has two stations and travelling time between the stations is approximately one minute. It is possible to hop on and off at both stations and travelling is free of charge. The elevator's rail is about 130 meters long and height difference between two stations about 30 meters.\nThe State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.\nThe Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and \u00c5land, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 40 000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the fourth largest university in Finland (22,300 students in 2022), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. Approximately 9% of all students are international students. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is one of Finland's two Swedish-language universities. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the university and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences (TUAS) is the second largest polytechnic in Finland (12,000 students in 2022) after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. TUAS consists of six campus buildings in Turku and one separate campus in town of Salo. Bachelors of Business Administration, Social Services and Health Care Nursing study at Salo IoT Campus. TUAS offers Bachelor and Master studies in over 70 fields of education.\nAlso Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish-language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper was also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. Turkulainen was founded in 1958 but the newspaper has been on publishing break since 2020. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operated a regional television station, called Turku-TV, but station stopped operating in 2012. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents. All Finnish national TV channels are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area. In addition, a number of local radio stations, e.g. Auran Aallot, Radio Sata and Radio Robin Hood are operational. Local public service radio stations are Yle Turun Radio broadcasting in Finnish (the regional version of Yle Radio Suomi) and Yle Vega \u00c5boland broadcasting in Swedish (the regional version of Yle Vega).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nTurku is twinned with:\n\nIn March 2022, Turku suspended the agreement with Saint Petersburg, Russia (twinning since 1953) due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Co-operation agreements ===\nTurku has co-operation agreements with:\n\n Tallinn, Estonia\n Tianjin, China\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nArchipelago Sea\nBishop Henry\nChristmas Peace\nGreat Fire of Turku\nHistory of Turku\nKing's Road\nPosankka\nRoyal Academy of Turku\nTurku Cemetery\n\n\n=== Other medieval cities and towns of Finland ===\nNaantali\nPorvoo\nRauma\nUlvila\nVyborg (now in Russia)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nLahtinen, Rauno (2015).

The town is situated in Ostrobothnia, along the Gulf of Bothnia. The population is approximately 7,000, while the sub-region has a population of approximately 52,000. It is the 127th most populous municipality in Finland.\nNykarleby is a bilingual municipality with Finnish and Swedish as its official languages. The population consists of 7% Finnish speakers, 84% Swedish speakers, and 10% speakers of other languages.\nThe largest employers in the town are Prevex (member of KWH Group), a packaging and piping products manufacturer, Westwood, which manufactures wooden staircases, and in the village of Jeppo, KWH Mirka, a coated abrasives manufacturer. A Swedish-speaking art school (Svenska Konstskolan) is located in Nykarleby town.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe town is located at the mouth of the Lapua River. The name of the place was Lapuan Joensuu or 'mouth of Lapua river'. The municipality was founded in 1607 by merging parts of Peders\u00f6re and V\u00f6r\u00e5 into a new parish. In 1620, the small village of Lepua was chartered as a city, with the Swedish name Nykarleby, which means 'New Karleby'; the Finnish name is a Finnicized version of the same. The town was chartered in the same year as the nearby city of Kokkola, or in Swedish, Gamlakarleby (later, Karleby).\nThe battles of Nykarleby and Jutas were fought there between Swedish and Russian troops during the Finnish War in 1808.\nZacharias Topelius, an important author in Finland, was born in Nykarleby.\nIn 1995, the small, idyllic town was ranked as \"the happiest city in Finland\" in a controversial article in Helsingin Sanomat, the leading newspaper of Finland.

  "Kokkola": "Kokkola (Finnish: [\u02c8kok\u02d0ol\u0251]; Swedish: Karleby, Finland Swedish: [\u02c8k\u0251rle\u02ccby\u02d0]) is a town in Finland and the regional capital of Central Ostrobothnia. It is located on the west coast of the country, on the Gulf of Bothnia. The population of Kokkola is approximately 48,000, while the sub-region has a population of approximately 54,000. It is the 22nd most populous municipality in Finland, and the 20th most populous urban area in the country.\nKokkola covers an area of 2,730.80 square kilometres (1,054.37 sq mi) of which 1,286.61 km2 (496.76 sq mi) is water. The population density is 33.44 inhabitants per square kilometre (86.6/sq mi). Neighbour municipalities are Halsua, Kalajoki, Kannus, Kaustinen, Kronoby, Lestij\u00e4rvi, Larsmo and Toholampi.\nKokkola is a bilingual municipality with Finnish and Swedish as its official languages. The population consists of 83% Finnish speakers, 12% Swedish speakers, and 6% speakers of other languages.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n\n=== Name ===\n\nIn the oldest Swedish sources Kokkola is mentioned as Karlabi. The town was known in Swedish by the name Gamlakarleby until 1 January 1977 when the surrounding land municipality of Kaarlela (Swedish: Karleby) was consolidated with Kokkola, and the town took over the Swedish name of Karleby. The word gamla means \"old\", karl (anglicanized Charles), is a Germanic males name, a name of many kings, meaning simply \"man\" and by means \"village\", so the town name is ambiguous meaning both \"old village of Charles\" or \"old man village\". The Latin name was Carolina Vetus. Gustav II Adolf, the founder of the city, possibly named the town in honor of his father King Karl IX of Sweden. The Finnish name is possibly derived from Kokkolahti, a narrow bay located at the place of the town. According to a tale the sea eagles (in Finnish merikotka or kokko) used to live there. Another theory claims that the name comes from ancient signal fires (kokko), which were used to warn people about approaching enemy troops.\n\n\n=== Heraldry ===\nThe coat of arms of Kokkola is based on the city seal issued in 1620 in connection with the founding of the city. The pattern is a symbol of tar burning and tar trade, which have played a significant part in the history of the city since its founding until the 19th century. The coat of arms was designed by Olof Eriksson and Into I. Suominen, and it was confirmed for use on 17 December 1956.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe town of Kokkola was chartered in 1620 by King Gustav II Adolf of Sweden when Finland was a part of the Swedish Empire and is one among the oldest towns in Finland. The king also decided that a tar barrel, with three burning flames coming from both the ends and the plug, should be used as the town seal, because of the tar trade at that time, for which Kokkola was founded as a shipping port. Anders Chydenius (1729-1803) who was one of the leading politicians of Sweden, was a keen supporter of economic freedom and fought in the Swedish Parliament for free foreign trade and further social reforms. In 1765 the Swedish Parliament granted the city of Kokkola the staple rights. Kokkola also became an important shipbuilding centre in Finland. As a result of tar trade and shipbuilding industry, Kokkola was for a time one of the richest towns in Finland.\n\nAn interesting historical affair, known as the Skirmish of Halkokari, occurred at the town on 7 June 1854 during the \u00c5land War, part of the Crimean War. Royal Marines from HMS Vulture and HMS Odin tried to come ashore to deal with public property in the town \"in accordance with the usages of war\". The marines were repelled by local defenders armed with hunting rifles supported by troops, artillery and possibly Russian advisors and military. One of the 9 smaller British craft (a gunboat) fell into the hands of the defenders. As such, this boat was the only Royal Navy vessel still in foreign possession in 1914. The boat is still today a museum-object and can be seen in Kokkola's English Park. The town council has refused to return the boat despite several requests by the United Kingdom, most recently by John Stuttard, the Lord Mayor of London. The British Treasury annually pays a small sum to the local church congregation for the maintenance of the graves of nine Royal Marines killed in action during the skirmish .\nInteresting contemporaneous accounts of the disastrous action can be found in the British Newspaper Archive, citing Gamla Carleby.\nThe city had a Swedish-speaking majority until 1933.\nIn 1977, the surrounding municipality of Kaarlela (Swedish: Karleby) was consolidated into Kokkola (Swedish until then: Gamlakarleby). In 2009, the municipalities of Lohtaja, K\u00e4lvi\u00e4 and Ullava were consolidated with Kokkola.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nKokkola is the capital of the Central Ostrobothnia region, it is located on the coast of Gulf of Bothnia, the northernmost part of the Baltic Sea. The next larger cities are Vaasa is 121 kilometres (75 miles) southwest, and Oulu is 198 kilometres (123 miles) northeast. The distance to the capital Helsinki is 483 kilometres (300 miles) to the south. Neighbouring cities and municipals are Kalajoki in the northern east, Kannus and Toholampi in the east, Halsua and Kaustinen in the southern east, Kronoby in the south and Larsmo in the southern west.\nThe landscape of the region around Kokkola is flat, typical for the area of Ostrobothnia, with numerous river courses flowing through the land. The biggest river in the area is Perhonjoki, which flows into Gulf of Bothnia, north of Kokkola.\nThe annual post-glacial rebound at Kokkola is 8.8 mm. Thus large areas of present-day Kokkola were under water when the town was founded.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nThe city of Kokkola has 48,368 inhabitants, making it the 22nd most populous municipality in Finland.
